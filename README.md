# Air-Quality-and-COVID-19-Data-Analysis-Project
This is a data analytics project where common technologies such as postgreSQL, Python, R and PowerBI are used to conduct insightful analysis on world air quality data and its impact on COVID-19 infection, death and recovery rate.
Recently, the world has undergone irreversible changes due to the unfortunate pandemic of COVID-19. Within this project we explore key datasets related to this pandemic, as well as world air quality data to notice interesting correlations between the two. The worsening quality of air is a real and ongoing issue in today's society, and this project aims to analyse the big data available on the topic, to break the problem down into stratified and identifiable problem areas. We will attempt to answer some key questions such as:
  1. What are the top polluted cities?
  2. Trends in Air Quality based on seasons, improvement over years etc.
  3. Comparision between the air qualities of different countries.

**Background Information about the datasets used**

The datasets used are chosen for a reason as they clearly mention relevant and important metrics. Additionally, global data is preferred rather than localised national data, as it will provide a broader and more accurate answer to the real world problem. Localised data may include bias that are only relevant to that particular region. Here is a outline for some of the important columns in the datasets.

**Air Quality Data**
The data is based on country codes and different regions in that specific country. Additionally, data over recent few years is available on each region of a country (2010-2022). The variance of data in these time frames and certain trends is also explored in the data analysis. Key metrics include, pm10,pm25 and n02 concentration which are key constituents of poor air quality. Furthermore pm25 is the most dangerous and important particulate to control as it is responsible for adverse health effects in humans.
